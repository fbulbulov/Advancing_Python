These quantities attempt to measure the perceived temperature to humans based on air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, things which we can measure directly. You could think of an apparent temperature as the result of a kind of feature engineering, an attempt to make the observed data more relevant to what we actually care about: how it actually feels outside!\n",

    "The actual usefulness of a feature depends on the model you use it with. A feature is only useful to the extent that its relationship with the target is one your model can learn. Just because a feature has a high MI score doesn't mean your model will be able to do anything with that information. You may need to transform the feature first to expose the association."
